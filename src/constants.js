  pc: `This is my PC — the heart of my coding adventures. I mostly work in JavaScript/TypeScript, but I also enjoy Python and a bit of C for fun.
    I’ve built web apps, games, and some quirky projects I’m proud of.
    You can check out my work on <a href="https://github.com/Anuraj-IND" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>!`,
  "cs-degree": `This is my BTech CS degree. I keep it here as a reminder of all the late-night assignments, group projects, and exam panic.
    Sure, it’s theoretical, but it gave me a solid foundation to build real-world projects.`,
  "sofa-table": `That’s my chill spot. I crash here to binge YouTube — mostly tech, programming, and the occasional random rabbit hole.
    I also dream up project ideas here, some of which end up becoming hackathon submissions or small prototypes.`,
  tv: `That’s my TV. Lately I’ve been learning from channels like:
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LoveBabbar" target="_blank">Love Babbar</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>,
   and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward" target="_blank">takeUforward</a>. They’re great for practice problems and interview prep.`,
  bed: `This is where I crash, and ironically, where I get the best project ideas.
    Half the time I’m grabbing my phone at 2 AM to note them down before they vanish into the void.`,
resume: `This is my desk — and on it, my resume. 
<a href="https://github.com/Anuraj-IND/Anuraj-Portfolio/blob/main/public/Anuraj%20Maddheshiya.pdf" target="_blank">Open resume</a>
— I’ll keep it updated!`,



  projects: `About this portfolio: it’s a 2D game-style site made with Kaboom.js and HTML/CSS for the UI.
    Right now it’s a single-player interactive portfolio — no chat or multiplayer yet. Hosting is done with free hosting services.
    If you want the code structure or files for any section, I can generate them next.`,
  library: `That’s my tech book collection — some I finished, most I started and then got distracted by a new project.
    There’s even one in a language I’m still learning. Classic developer behavior, right?`,
  exit: `To exit my portfolio game, just close the tab — or if you prefer, leave a note in the guestbook (when I add one).`,
